# LIRI Bot

### Overview
The Liri app allows users to search for songs, concerts, and movies. I used Api keys from spotify, Bands in town, and omdb to retrieve information. The concert-this command will show the concert venue, date, and city the artist will be performing at. The spotify-this-song command will show the artist name, album, song title, and the spotify url link to the specific song. The movie-this command will show the actors name, movie title, release date, ratings from Imdb and rotten tomatoes, the country it was made in, language, and plot.
